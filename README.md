# CryptoShit
Crappy encoder and decoder. Pretty useless, unless you're too bored and has nothing to do with cryptography. Really.

There's no reasons why you should use it, it was made for fun and I bet you don't like this kind of fun. But if you want to use it, 
go ahead and do it. Yes, try it out, I dare you. I double dare you!
